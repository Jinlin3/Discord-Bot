# Discord-Bot
**Multi-purpose discord bot for gaming disguised as Christian Cruz bot as for now... will implement team-balancing features soon!**
### Current Objectives
* Introduce discrepancy values to denote team imbalances when using the $balance command
* Introduce randomizer for teams
* Improve balancing for odd-numbered teams
* Stopping Discord from banning the bot every so often
### Websites Used
* Replit (Online IDE's are good for this type of project)
* UptimeRobot (Currently pinging the bot every 10 minutes)

* $del + (Player number) *(while in team mode)* : Deletes a player in the roster by their player number
* $clear *(while in team mode)* : Clears roster
* $balance *(while in team mode)* : Balances players in roster
